This a CSS framework for writers of manuals, tutorials and documentation
that provides a lot of power and flexibility using ordinary HTML markup.
It makes sense to use the 'language of the web' to produce documents and
this makes it a lot easier for a writer to do clever things like box-outs,
images with captions, tick-lists, columns, frequently used table styles
and many more cute and useful things.

The cheat sheet is at http://vulpeculox.net/misc/style showcases most
features.  The documentation is also there.  Download the complete 
package from there or here with style.zip.  

Benefits for readers:
* Consistent use of elements for ease of interpretation
* Easy formatting means better, easier to read layout
* Rich formatting can give direction and clarity 

Benefits for writers:
* All your documents have a standard look and feel
* Simplification of formatting and features
* Easy formatting means better layout, clearer documents
* Quick picking of complex styles

Why GitHub?
(1) My testing facilities are limited.
(2) There are probably CSS tricks that could be used to improve the code.
Whilst dedicated programmers may do Gity things with repositories, there
is another way to make improvements.  Simply email changes or thoughts.
