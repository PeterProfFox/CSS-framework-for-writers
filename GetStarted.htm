  <h3>Welcome</h3>
  Welcome to Peter Fox's CSS framework for HTML authoring.
  The background is that I've written many user guides and tutorials in HTML and ended up
  re-inventing the wheel.  My style and the style you'll see here is quite different
  to that produced by a word processor for presentation in PDF.  With HTML you can
  use layout to make it much more punchy by using 'standard' formulas of 'look-at-this',
  'here is a summary', 'here is a differently presented example in a frame' and so on.  
  Perhaps most important of these is the <span class=emph>box-out</span> which conveys
  nuggets of information and possible actions.
  <p></p>
  <h6 class="info w5 right"><u>Keen to learn?</u>Studying the CSS and the HTML here will be useful for people who 
    know a little bit but haven't really got stuck-in</h6>
  <span class=arrowW>An</span> obvious example of something that 
  we often see on the screen but wouldn't on paper is the contents box to the left here.
  <p></p>
  Boxouts like this one are an easy to implement screen idiom making use of distinctive
  styling to convey <span class="arrowE">purpose</span>
  <p></p>                  
  <span class=arrowNW>The</span> screen idiom of an always available master navigation is implemented in the
    'menu bar' fixed to the top of the view independently of document scrolling.
  <div class="boxOut left wall">Don't like some style or feature?  Change it and evolve your own look-and-feel

  <a name="purpose"></a><h1><u>1</u>Purpose of this document</h1>
  <a name="p-who"></a><h2><u>1.1</u>Who should use it</h2>
  <div class="boxOut right w5"><span class=tick0>This</span> is not suitable for creating cool,
     flashy web sites.
     <p></p>
     <span class=tick1>If</span> you want richly formatted documentation that works across
       most browsers that look a bit like this one then this is for you.
     </div>
  Writing in HTML is not for everybody.  Firstly of course you must have something to say and 
  the ability to put it into logical blocks and words.  Then you need a basic knowledge of HTML
  and CSS and an editor to hack at bare tags.  If you want to write documents such as
  user guides, manuals and even just reports that take advantage of the features that
  are available on a screen that you don't get with 'designed for paper' then read on.
  <p></p>
    Why not use the universal language of the screen to write for it?  Because it can be a tedious fiddly pain.
    That's why I've put this together so when I need some formatting or feature I can quickly pick it
    from the tool-kit.
  <a name="p-why"></a><h2><u>1.2</u>Benefits of a framework</h2>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class=w3>
        A framework is just a lot of CSS rules and a bit of documentation.
        Obviously it is useful to be able to style basic elements such as
        <span class="tag code">H1</span> and anyone who has written user guides will
        have developed bits of style such as <span class=code>DIV.alert{border:3 solid red;}</span> etc.
        This gives <span class=emph>styling speed and consistency.</span>
        <p></p>
        What I've done here is tidy up my standard framework and documented it
        so you can re-use what I re-use.

<a name="coding"></a><h1><u>3</u>Coding HTML</h1>
Firstly have a look at the <span class=emph>cheat sheet</span> to get a feel for what can be done. 
You'll see things like <span class=code>span=emph</span> or strange things like <b>w3</b>.  These 
are clues to the key words you add to the HTML elements to make things happen.
<a name="c-basics"></a><h2><u>3.1</u>Basics</h2>
<h3><u>3.1.1</u>Reference the stylesheet</h3>
  <h6 class="hint w3 right">
    <u>Tip</u>
    Put this line towards the top of the HEAD block as it means you will be able to tweak in-line
    underneath to override the standard in special cases.</h6>
  Somewhere in the <span class="code tag">HEAD</span> section you'll want to add something like
  <span class="tag code">link href="PefStdDoc.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"</span>.
  You can of course change the name or add a path.  <span class=emph><span class="tick0">Do</span> not reference the 
  version at <span class=path>vulpeculox.net</span> directly.</span>
<h3><u>3.1.2</u>Adding classes to tags</h3>
  <h6 class="info w3 right">
    <u>Class matters</u>
    Everything depends on adding one or more classes to HTML elements.<br>
    <i>That's all there is to it</i><br>
    <span class="red">Class/style names are case sensitive</span>    
    </h6>
  Suppose you want to put <b>I'd give it five stars</b> in quotes.  Here is all 
  you do:<br><span class="m2 code">&lt;span <b>class=q</b>&gt;I'd give it five stars&lt;/span&gt;</span><br>
  and this is the result<br>
  <span class="m2 q">I'd give it five stars</span><br>
<h3><u>3.1.3</u>Combining tags</h3>
  <h6 class="hint w6 right">
    <u>Quotes</u>
    Single or double are both allowed</i>
    </h6> 
  <h6 class="hint w3 right">
    <u>Quotes</u>
    When tags are combined they must be surrounded in quotes.
    <i>You can get away without quotes for a single class.</i>
    </h6> 
<ul class=bare>
<li><span>Vulpeculox</span> Plain ...
<li><span class="blue">Vulpeculox</span> <b>blue</b> added ...</td>
<li><span class="blue bgblu">Vulpeculox</span> <b>bgblu</b> added ...</td>
<li><span class="blue bgblu shadow">Vulpeculox</span> <b>shadow</b> added ...</td>
<li><span class="blue bgblu shadow tick0">Vulpeculox</span> <b>tick0</b> added</td>
</ul>
Now you could have hours of fun playing with combinations... <span class=m1>...<span> <b>but don't!</b> 
Let your jazzed-up formatting be driven by your needs.  The cheat sheet and to some extent
this tutorial contain far too many fancy things for the average document.

<h3><u>3.1.4</u>Start at the top</h3>
<h6 class="info w3 right">
    <u>Base font</u>
    Normally, for consistent look-and-feel you would edit the CSS to set the default font.
    Alternatively, for a once-off you could adapt the following to suit in a
    <span class="tag code">STYLE</span> block.
    <span class=code>body{font-family:Serif;}</span></h6>
  The way I start my documents is as follows:
<table>
  <tr><td><span class="code tag">div class=topMenu</span></td>
      <td>This is fixed to the top of the <i>viewing</i> screen and is used for <span class="tag code">A</span> links for navigating a library of documents.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td><span class="code tag">div class=title1</span></td>
      <td>Global context</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td><span class="code tag">div class=title2</span></td>
      <td>Specific purpose of document</td>
  </tr>
</table>  
After that anything can happen.

<h3><u>3.1.5</u>Frequently used styles</h3>
<table>
<tr><td>
<ul>
<li>Of course <span class="tag code">H1</span>, <span class="tag code">H2</span> and <span class="tag code">H3</span> 
 Note that <span class="tag code">H1</span> and <span class="tag code">H2</span> will force their way onto
 a 'new line' but you may need to add <b>clear</b> to <span class="tag code">H3</span> if you've got floating bits before it. 
 <div class="boxOut wall">
    Start the heading text with something underlined to have it
    appear as a section number in the left margin.</div>  
<li><span class="tag code">div class=boxOut</span> with various combinations of <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, <b>w4</b> and <b>w5</b>
 is a really handy way to encapsulate a nugget.  It is just a <span class="tag code">DIV</span>
 with fancy formatting. 
    <div class="boxOut wall">The <b>w</b> styles are used all the time. 
    Single digits are fractions, double digits percentages.
    <b>wall</b> is variable up to 100% - often used to override the default 25% width of <b>boxOut</b></div>
</ul>
</td><td>
<ul> 
<li><span class="tag code">TABLE</span> without any class sets up a grid without lines.  This is handy
  for when you want to split the width in a definite way.  It is often much easier to force the layout
  that you want with a table rather than relying on floats.  <span class="tag code">TD class=w4</span> say
  will try to restrict the width of a particular column to 25%.  It's not ideal but often works.
<li> <span class="tag code">UL class=bare</span> is a convenient way to structure vertical space. 
    Adding a <b>w</b>-class can be handy to stop it sprawling right across the page. 
<li> <span class="tag code">UL class=ticks</span> is great for ticks, crosses and boxes.
</ul>
</td></tr></table>

<a name="c-boxes"></a><h2><u>3.2</u>The joy of box</h2>
Have a look at the H6 section of the cheat sheet.  There are two important points to notice
<ol>
<li>The complete styling is done in one go.  This means you can allocate certain boxes for
    particular purposes.  In my world helpful hints and tips are <span class=emph>always</span> 
    green.  This leads the way to quick, consistent formatting and faster comprehension by the
    reader. You can of course tweak these styles and even add pictorial icons if you want
    but always put directness of communication before cuteness of candy.
<li>The layout is a not tabular.  In fact these boxes <span class="q">float</span>.  For example the 
    black box has floated left until it bumps up agsinst the blue box.  As well as <b>left</b>
    and <b>right</b> you can use <b>center</b> or <b>centre</b>.
</ol>
<h6 class=warn>
  <u>Floating minefield</u>
  Whilst you can do really useful things with <span class="tag code">div class=boxOut</span>
  and <span class="tag code">H6</span> they upset the normal flow of the main content.
  Sometimes it goes horribly wrong.  Tables are simpler if suitable.</h6>

  <div class="frame2 round1 floatFix bgblu">
    <h6 class="w5 fact left"><u>fact</u><span class="code">fact <b>w5 left</b></span><br>20% width. Float towards the left.  (Bumps up against left margin)</h6>

  <div class="left w3 shadow">
    The source code for these examples is exactly the same.  The H6s just follow on one after another.

&lt;h6 ... dont right&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/h6&gt;
    </div>
    
    <div class="boxOut wall">Note that the grey frames are round DIVS.  These needed the <b>floatFix</b> style adding.
    (The reason is that the floated elements, in this case all the boxes, have been taken out of the flow and
    the browser doesn't count them as taking up vertical space.)
    </div>
  </div>
  <h6 class="hint down center w75"><u>Get out of float trouble</u>You may find that a floating box interferes in an unpleasant way
  with what comes next.  There are two things to try:<br>
  1 Put a <span class="code tag">DIV class=floatFix</span>
  around the offending box and its host section.<br>  
  2 Add <b>left</b> and <b>down</b> to the following item.

</h6>      
There are two different reasons for using tables.  Firstly to organise the layout and
secondly to display tabular data.  If I had a long narrative report then I'd probably
put it into two columns as shorter lines are easier to read.  The great advantage of
tables for controlling layout over floats is that you force rows and columns to align
regardless.  If you look at the source code of <span class="arrowNW">section 1.2</span>
you'll see that this is a nest of two tables.  Lets see what it would look like without
the outer table.  I think the narrower columns make it a lot easier to read.

secondly to display tabular data.  If I had a long narrative report then I'd probably
put it into two columns as shorter lines are easier to read.  The great advantage of
tables for controlling layout over floats is that you force rows and columns to align
regardless.  If you look at the source code of <span class="arrowNW">section 1.2</span>
you'll see that this is a nest of two tables.  Lets see what it would look like without
the outer table.  I think the narrower columns make it a lot easier to read.

<h3><u>3.3.2</u>Coding tables for layout</h3>
<div class="boxOut w3 right">
  <span class=emph>You need to know the basics of HTML tables.</span>
  Simply a <span class="tag code">TABLE</span> contains a number of rows
  (<span class="tag code">TR</span>) which in turn contain a number
  of cells (<span class="tag code">TD</span>). <i>Always TDs inside TRs.</i>
  Put whatever you like inside the TDs.
</div>  
The cheat sheet tells you all you need to know about informal tables used
to organise layout.  There's nothing much to it really.  Don't forget you can
easily make your table smaller by adding a width class to it.  Formatting
styles applied to the TABLE often cascade down to every cell.
 

<h3><u>3.3.3</u>Coding tables for tabular data display</h3>
Once again the cheat sheet should tell you all you need to know.  The key thing is
the <b>table</b> class.  That will get you started.
<h6 class="w4 right warn"><u>Internet Explorer</u>Versions less than 9 can't format columns in one go.  You have to style each TD!</h6> 
<p>
Adding class <b>table</b> to <span class="tag code">TABLE</span> gives a bare white grid.
The default alignment of text in cells is to the left but you can override this by specifying
columns to justify right - typically for figures - with <b>c</b><i>-column number-</i><b>r</b>.
For example <b>c4r</b> will right justify the fourth column.
<p>
Classes <b>total</b> and <b>none</b> can be added to the <span class="code tag">TR</span> tag.
In the cheat sheet the comment at the bottom of the table is actually a blanked-out row.
<p>
It is often convenient to have the title of a table attached to it.  For this purpose
the first row is commandeered for a table-wide heading using <b>titleR1</b>.  You 
have to <span class="code">colspan=6</span> or however many columns there are.
When using this feature you can stick headings on the second row with <b>shadeR2</b>
instead of the usual <b>shadeR1</b>.

<!-- LISTS -->
<a name="c-lists"></a><h2><u>3.4</u>Lists for layout and action</h2>
As with tables we can use lists for two purposes: A convenient way of organising
vertical space and a powerful communication tool.  Have a look at the cheat sheet
for what you need to know.  Notice how in all cases the real-estate of the list
nicely encompasses the whole thing.<p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>bare</b> style gives you what is in effect a single column table.  What use is that?
    Well you could put it inside a single row table when you don't want rows matching across.
    You can use it to become a series of paragraphs, perhaps with different styling.  (Adding
    <b>dotted</b> makes this more obvious.)  Most usefully you can quickly whisk-up a list
    to put beside some text with something like <span class="code tag">UL class="bare bgblu w4 right frame1"</span> 
    <span class="emph">(Bare list, sky background, 25% width floated right with a single line frame.)</span> 
    <p>
<li><span class="tag code">UL class=ticks</span> is a good way to implement a checklist.  The
    default item glyph is a bare box.  Add <b>t0</b>, <b>t1</b>, <b>b0</b> or <b>b1</b> to each
    list item as required. <p>
<li>Adding <b>title</b> to <span class="code tag">UL</span> turns the first item into a
    title.  This might appear an odd thing to do at first but it can be quite handy to
    make sure that the title is closely associated with the list so that as the list 
    moves or shifts during laying out it can't get separated.  <span class="emph">This
    doesn't work with OL.</span><p> 
<li>Adding <b>dotted</b> to <span class="code tag">UL</span> or <span class="code tag">OL</span>
    introduces a break line between items which can sometimes be visually pleasing and 
    helps to separate items.<p>
<li>Normally sub-lists are implemented by nesting ULs or OLs within LIs.  You can 'cheat'
    by adding <b>m</b>-something to the list item.  This is only sensible works for UL. 
</ul>


<a name="c-images"></a><h2><u>3.5</u>Pictures made simple</h2>
We're all familiar with <span class="code tag">IMG</span> but we're also familiar with 
reluctance to stick where they're put and stay with their caption. The cheat sheet shows
the code and examples.  The styling of the caption is done in the CSS
(<span class="code">div.img</span>) so you may want to have a look at that.

<a name="c-misc"></a><h2><u>3.6</u>Miscellaneous features</h2>
<h3><u>3.6.1</u>Email address</h3>
One of the annoyances of the web is the harvesting of email addresses to be used to send spam.
There is a technique used in the framework which makes it difficult for bots to steal
this while being perfectly readable to a human.  To use it you need to edit the
following two lines in the framework CSS:-
<div class="w2 code">span.email:before {content:"<span class=blue">some_post_box</span>";}
span.email:after  {content:"<span class=blue">some_domain</span>";}
</div>
In the HTML you put just <span class="code">&lt;span class=email&gt;@&lt;span&gt;</span>.
When it comes to being displayed all browsers show the full email address
and only IE allows it to be cut and pasted whole.  Most browsers only cut the '@'.
<p>
If you want to vary the email address on a document by document basis then put the 'before' and 'after' tweaks
into a <span class="code tag">STYLE</span> block after the link to the framework CSS file. 


<h3><u>3.6.2</u>Blocks of code</h3>
Being a programmer I often want to display blocks of code.  That's simple except in IE.
<span class="code tag">DIV class=code</span> with the lines of code inside.  There are
two <span class="code tag">SPAN</span>s that work inside a code div.
<ul>
<li><b>note</b> An discussion about the code
<li><b>slashes</b> formatting for where double-slash would be used
</ul>


<a name="c-cols"></a><h2><u>3.7</u>Newspaper columns</h2>
<div class="col15 colRule">
  This text should be displayed in a number of columns.  Each is declared as "15 em" wide.  If not then the
  browser doesn't support 'newspaper' columns.  (We discussed the benefits of narrower columns of text
  <a href="#c-tables">above</a>.)  The advantage of a newspaper column over a table is that the content
  will automatically be flowed from the bottom of one column across to the top of the next and so on.
  <p>
  You can specify the number of columns you want with <b>col2</b>, <b>col3</b> or <b>col4</b> but usually
  a better way is to set the column width and let the browser do the rest.  These widths are nominally
  in ems but you may want to experiment.  The classes to use are <b>col10</b>, <b>col15</b>, <b>col20</b> or <b>col25</b>.
  The other column style is <b>colRule</b> which adds a dotted line between columns.
  <p>
  Experiment by resizing the width of your browser to see how this works.  The style for this DIV is <b>col15 colRule</b>
</div>

<h6 class="warn w4 left"><u>Zone of fail</u>Browsers vary from appalling to not very good &mdash;

It is quite possible to print HTML but don't expect advanced formatting and web-fonts to work.
The on-line HTML to PDF converters range from 'give-up' to 'something recognisable'. 
<p>
One of the issues is breaking pages.  Basically anything other than a hard page break is 
unreliable.  To force a new page add <b>newPage</b> to something like a <span class="code tag">P</span>

<a name="style"></a><h1><u>5</u>Authoring and style</h1>
<div class=fixFloat>
    <a name="s-different"></a><h2><u>5.1</u>HTML is different</h2>
    <div class="w3 left">
    Writing directly in HTML is not suitable for everything or everybody &mdash; far from it.
    However there is a niche for documents that carry a lot of information
    and exploit the features of HTML to get it across to the reader effectively.
    The purpose of this framework is to make it quicker to present
    documents with consistent style.
    <p>
    This document is a good example of the sort of use for HTML.  A tutorial often benefits
    from compartmentalisation of information and quick summaries.  Obviously while writing
    this I've use a plethora of effects while you may find your work is 90% plain text
    with the odd table or picture.  Nevertheless the framework makes it easy for you
    to create a standard look and feel to your documents and sorts out a lot of tricky CSS
    styling and positioning so all you have to do is bash the words onto the screen.

    <a name="s-developing"></a><h2><u>5.2</u>Developing your own</h2>
    <h6 class="hint right w2"><u>Steal the CSS</u>The CSS in this framework has a number of tricks
    that you may want to use elsewhere.  By all means do so.</h6>
    What you see here is my style that I've developed and amalgamated over time.
    I expect you'll want to tweak the appearance to suit your preferences and add
    features.  For that you have to get stuck into the CSS.  In the mean time
    have a play so you can get a feel for the convenience of things like <b>H6</b> and <b>DIV=img</b>.
    <p>
    <span class="emph">You'll almost certainly want to fiddle with fonts.</span> 

    <a name="s-reader"></a><h2><u>5.3</u>Remember the reader</h2>
    Finally remember the reader.  They are probably tired and don't want to read your stuff anyway.
    That's what I like about HTML, you can add interest by directing attention.  A few boxes, a
    list of ticks and so on can encourage the reader to keep on going, take bits at a time and 
    feel they are making quick progress.
